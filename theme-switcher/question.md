## Theme Switcher Component

Create an Angular component that allows users to toggle between light and dark themes for the application.

**Requirements:**
- Display a toggle switch or button to change the theme.
- Persist the user's theme preference using local storage.
- Apply the selected theme across the application by updating a CSS class on the root element.
- Optionally, detect the user's system theme preference on first load.
- The component should be usable in any Angular template as follows:

```html
<app-theme-switcher></app-theme-switcher>
```

**Bonus:**
- Add a smooth transition effect between themes.
